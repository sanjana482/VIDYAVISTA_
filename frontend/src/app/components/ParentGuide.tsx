          Annual fees depend on the city, board, facilities and whether the school is a day or boarding school. International boards and residential campuses generally cost more than day schools following national or state boards. When you compare, look beyond tuition: ask about admission and development charges, transport, uniform, books, activities and hostel or meal fees so you can plan the full yearly cost.
